# Introduction
The human resource department in any organisation plays a crucial role in managing their employees and their management. It caters to large set of activities in simultaneous mode and for this reason, the functioning of HR department is not easy. HR Department has to go through several challenges and various measures to make the company self-sufficient, robust and independent in bringing more profit and revenue.

From managing the employees to handling the risk management of the company, it is the responsibility of human resource department to look after. Getting all the HR activities done in the offline fashion requires lot of time and this will lead to stress, work pressure and error. On the other hand, implementation of an HR software comes with great help. With its vast features the Open HRMS software can provide proper backup for the functioning of the HR department. The Connect HRMS software automates every process happening in the HR department, reducing the workload of HR department, and boosting their productivity. Also all the data about the organisation are digitally stored when the Connect HRMS software comes in to work.

# Conception
The development of conceptual models of an information system requires the use of several diagrams in order to define and visualize these models in a clear and precise manner.

- __USE CASE DIAGRAM :__
A use case diagram is a modeling tool to better understand and describe the functional requirements of the system. It is the first UML step for designing a system.

- __SEQUENCE DIAGRAMS :__
A sequence diagram is a type of interaction diagram that describes the sequence of actions that occur between different objects or actors in a system. It shows how different objects or actors interact with each other by exchanging messages in an ordered sequence.

- __CLASS DIAGRAM :__
A class diagram is a visual tool used in software engineering to represent the structure and relationships between classes in a system. It shows classes, their attributes and operations using rectangles divided into three sections. Classes are linked together by lines to indicate associations, inheritances, or dependencies between them.

Angular is an open source framework written in JavaScript that allows the creation of web applications, particularly so-called "single page applications". A web application accessible from a single web page. This optimizes the user experience and avoids loading the page with each new action. The framework is based on MVC architecture, allowing you to separate data, images and actions to better manage responsibilities. Extensively proven architecture that enables high maintainability and improved collaboration.
# Application overview
- __Authentication interface :__
The following figure shows the authentication interface, from which the user can
access your admin or employee space
